## Major touchpoints

Onboarding to a new project team at work. The team I had been working on reached a point of pausing new React development while they look at larger design issues. The new team has some momentum on some React tasks that they want to get working on in the next couple of months. Hopefully by then we will have a permanent UI team working with React that I will join.

## Sewing

Picked up a gaming desk which will be a new sewing table. Shortly after my move to Atlanta, I fell off a scooter and broke a bone in my hand. This has put a lot of setting up my crafting on hold for the last several months. A long-term goal of mine has been to learn how to make made-to-measure button-down shirts. Off-the-rack shirts have always been a little bit off due to my body proportions. And in the last few years with gender-affirming treatment, that has become a little bit more of a priority. The [Free Sewing Simone](https://freesewing.eu/designs/simone) looks like a good option.

## Music Collection

- [Nuda, "Intimate Senses"](https://nudamusic.bandcamp.com/album/intimate-senses) on Bandcamp.
- Making my collection more available by implementing Tailscale for phone access. 
- Identifying resources for [discovering radio streams](https://github.com/deroverda/recommended-radio-streams?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing).
